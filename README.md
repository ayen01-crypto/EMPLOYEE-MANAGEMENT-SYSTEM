## Installation Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Start your XAMPP/WAMP server
2. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
3. Import the `database_schema.sql` file to create the database and sample data
4. The database will be created with the name `employee_management`

### 2. File Setup
1. Copy all files to your web server directory:
   - For XAMPP: `C:\xampp\htdocs\coursework one\`
   - For WAMP: `C:\wamp64\www\coursework one\`

### 3. Configuration
1. Update database credentials in `handler.php` if needed (lines 12-15):
   ```php
   private $host = 'localhost';
   private $db_name = 'employee_management';
   private $username = 'root';
   private $password = '';
   ```

### 4. Access the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost/coursework%20one/interface.php`
3. The Employee Management System dashboard will load

## Technical Implementation

### Object-Oriented Design
The system follows PHP OOP principles with:
- **Database Class** - Handles database connections (in handler.php)
- **Employee Class** - Manages all employee operations (in handler.php)
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between interface (interface.php) and logic (handler.php)

### Security Features
- **Prepared Statements** - All database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Input Validation** - Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Data Sanitization** - All output is properly escaped using `htmlspecialchars()`

### Code Quality
- **Self-Documenting Code** - Clear variable and function names
- **Comments** - Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Error Messages** - Descriptive error messages for debugging
- **Consistent Formatting** - Clean, readable code structure

## Sample Data

The system comes pre-loaded with sample employee data:
- 5 sample employees across different departments
- 5 predefined departments
- Various employee statuses for testing

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers (responsive design)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Ensure MySQL is running in XAMPP/WAMP
   - Check database credentials in `config/database.php`
   - Verify database exists and is imported correctly

2. **Page Not Loading**
   - Ensure web server is running
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify correct URL path

3. **Forms Not Working**
   - Check PHP error logs
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Verify database connection

### Error Messages
The system provides clear error messages for:
- Database connection issues
- Invalid form data
- Missing required fields
- Duplicate employee IDs or emails
